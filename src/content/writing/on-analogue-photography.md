My iPhone can take better photos than most film cameras. It has computational photography, night mode, portrait mode with adjustable depth of field. It's objectively superior in almost every technical dimension.

And yet, I still shoot film.

## The Constraint is the Point

Film forces you to think before you shoot. You have 36 exposures, not 36,000. Each frame costs money. You can't review it instantly, delete it, try again.

This constraint makes you better. You compose more carefully. You wait for the right moment. You think about light, about framing, about what you're actually trying to capture.

Digital photography's infinite canvas paradoxically makes it harder to create intentionally. When everything is possible, nothing feels necessary.

## Friction as Feature

There's a word in Japanese: *ma* (間). It roughly translates to "negative space" or "pause"—the deliberate absence of action that gives meaning to what comes before and after.

Film photography is full of *ma*. The pause while you meter the light. The wait for the lab to process your roll. The moment when you see the developed negatives for the first time, weeks after you pressed the shutter.

Modern technology optimizes for reducing friction. But sometimes friction is where the meaning lives.

## Not Nostalgia

This isn't about romanticizing the past. Film isn't "better" than digital—it's different. It serves a different purpose.

Digital is for documentation, for iteration, for getting the shot. Film is for intention, for presence, for the process itself.

Both have their place. But in a world optimized for speed and volume, the slow alternative becomes valuable precisely because it's slow.
